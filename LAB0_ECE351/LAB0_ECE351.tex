    \subsection{What did you do over last summer, or what are you planning to do this upcoming summer?}
}

\HRule \\[10]
   
    \textbf{This upcoming summer, I would like to learn many new skills; I plan to start more projects through a maker space called Gizmo. Another skill that I would like to broaden is my use of computers. I may install a Linux operating system on my computer to learn how a computer operates on a more basic level.
    Additionally, I would like to apply for possible internships to further my career. } 



{\large
    \subsection{What do you personally want to get out of this lab?}
}

\HRule \\[10]

    \textbf{I personally am excited to be able to comprehend Latex on a deeper level; the last time I attempted to learn it, I was frustrated and gave up since there was no purpose for me to use it. However, this class will allow me to discover a new way to format papers professionally. By messing around with the formatting and looking up the formatting on the provided cheat sheet, I was able to understand it better. I am also exhilarated to be able to learn python. I previously taught myself some python over break, and I am excited to not only test my knowledge, but also learn more about python. Here is a frog to show my excitement:}
